# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute to the quality of this content by submitting PR's for improvements to code snippets, explanations, etc. If there's any doubt or if you think that a code/word/phrase is used confusingly, **before submitting a PR, open an issue to ask about it.**

However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content for the project. You probably guessed that already, but I just wanted to be extra clear on that.

## Typos?

Please don't worry about minor text typos. These will almost certainly be caught during the debugging process.

If you're going to submit a PR for typo fixes, please be measured in doing so by collecting several small changes into a single PR (in separate commits). Or, **just don't even worry about them for now,** because we'll get to them later. I promise.

## Search First!

Also, if you have any questions or concerns, please make sure to search the issues (both open and closed!) first, to keep the churn of issues to a minimum. I want to keep my focus on coding this project as much as possible.
